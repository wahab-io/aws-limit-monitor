# AWS Limit Monitor Solution
The AWS Limit Monitor Solution is a reference implementation that provides a foundation for monitoring AWS service limits. Customers can leverage the solution to monitor limits across services supported by Amazon Trusted Advisor; in multiple regions and multiple AWS accounts. The solution integrates with Amazon SNS and Slack to notify customers for service limits approaching thresholds.

## Getting Started
To get started with the AWS Limit Monitor Solution, please review the solution documentation. https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/limit-monitor/

## Running unit tests for customization
* Clone the repository, then make the desired code changes
* Next, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests
```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh  \n
./run-unit-tests.sh \n
```

## Building distributable for customization
* Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where cfn template will reside
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
```
_Note:_ You would have to create 2 buckets, one with prefix 'my-bucket-name' and another regional bucket with prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets  in bucket should be publicly accessible

* Now build the distributable:
```
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh \n
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET limit-monitor v1.0.0 $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET \n
```

* Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. _Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.

```
aws s3 cp ./global-s3-assets/ s3://my-bucket-name/limit-monitor/latest/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.template" --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name \n
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://my-bucket-name-<aws_region>/limit-monitor/latest/ --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.zip" --acl bucket-owner-full-control --profile aws-cred-profile-name \n
```

* Get the link of the limit-monitor.template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Deploy the AWS Limit Monitor Solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the limit-monitor.template.

## File Structure
The AWS Limit Monitor Solution project consists of 4 microservices which is deployed to a serverless environment in AWS Lambda.
